    <h1>Vnish Firmware vs. HiveOS: Which is Better?</h1>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
    If you're torn between using Vnish or HiveOS on your ASICs, you're not alone. Letâ€™s compare both to help you decide.</p>

    <h2>Interface:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vnish:</strong> Web-based dashboard on miner itself</li>
      <li><strong>HiveOS:</strong> Cloud dashboard with fleet management</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Performance:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vnish:</strong> Highly optimized for Antminers like L7/L9</li>
      <li><strong>HiveOS:</strong> More generalized support for GPU + ASIC rigs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Power Efficiency:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vnish:</strong> Focused on auto power tuning per chip</li>
      <li><strong>HiveOS:</strong> Manual fine-tuning possible with templates</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best For:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vnish:</strong> Single miners or small farms needing stability</li>
      <li><strong>HiveOS:</strong> Mixed farms or remote large-scale management</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong><br>
    Choose <strong>Vnish</strong> if you prioritize high performance, stability, and chip-level control. Choose <strong>HiveOS</strong> if you need central management for multiple devices across locations.</p>
